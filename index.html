                        My name is Sean K. Hall, I was born and raised in Washington and I'm greatful to have done so. The places that I've lived, including outside of Washington, are Texas, Arkansas and England. Aside from Washington, England was my favorite place to live because it reminded me of home so much. I was able to travel around the world due in a huge part to my previous career in The United States Air Force which I was a part of for seven years. I am glad to be out of the armed services but I am also fortunate for the people I connected with and experiences that I now have with me. Now that I am out I can persue a career that I will have much more passion and drive towards. Becoming a Software Developer is my main focus in life right now so that I can thrive as much as possible so that I can have an enjoyable life with my friends and family.

                    <br>
                        Outside of career specifc things about me I am a massive fan of superheros and virtually all mediums that they are presented in. Batman is my favorite character in all of ficton and has been for as long as I can remember, Batman the Animated Series and Batman '66 are the culprits that started this obsession. From there, anything that could involve superheroes I am fan of but another love are movies. I'm confident in saying that I enjoy all generas of movies and if there's one I dont like it's only because I haven't been exposed to it yet and I welcome new recomendations.

                    <br>
                        That's enough for now.

                    <br>
                    My professional goals are centered in and around becoming a proffesional Software Developer. To detail that goal further I want to graduate from Code Fellows, have security for my family and myself but most importantly to enjoy what I do for a living.
                    </br>
                    <br>
                    My personal goals, similar to my proffesional goals, are focused around one thing as well, superheroes. I would like to have my Software Development skills to go towards working for DC Comics. The exact job I would apply for in the future I currently have no idea but I'll figure that detail out along the way as my skills progress. The other major goal is to develop my fitness to a level that I'm proud with drawing inspiration from some of my favorite charactrs but at the same time, people in the real world too.
